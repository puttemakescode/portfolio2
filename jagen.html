            This is a project I worked on for a school project at my old school.
            A redesign of the a bookcover by the name of Jag, En. Which is a
            story about a person who wakes up in a new body every day. I used
            this opportunity to show as much representation as possible, so if
            you take a closer look all the symbols in this one person is to show
            representation of some sort. A piece I'm very happy with! :)
