            A protoype of an app created by me! This one is meant to keep up
            with your plants pace, download Florania, scan the plant that
            catches your eye and get the exact information needed! Find out what
            you need to keep your plant alive, where and how should i plant it
            and most importantly find out the name of different plants. This
            project was a fun one, something i wouldn't usually do in my spare
            time but I learned and had a lot of fun!
