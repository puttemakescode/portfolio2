            This is something i did in my spare time, me and a friend of mine
            decided to both do an illustration each and the only requirement we
            set was to have a flower. Unfortunately my friend didn't end up
            making an illustration however I decided to still go with it and
            this is a piece I'm very happy with! A lot of symbols and deeper
            meaning behind it if you take yourself a closer look.
